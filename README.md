# supply-chain-bc
A demo for blockchain's supply use case.

# Introduction
This is a demo of the supply chain use case that implements blockchain technology.

# Tech Used:
- React.js
- Node.js
- Solidity
- Web3.js

# Work Flow
A person can login as a farmer, wholesaler, retailer, or a customer. A farmer can create new assets and transfer the ownership to others. The wholesalers and retailers can only receive and  transfer the ownership. They cannot create assets and can transfer ownership of the assets that they own. The customer can look at all the previous ownerships of an asset before purchasing, thereby having proof of authenticity.

# How to Use?
After cloning, enter the backend folder in the terminal and execute `npm i`. Repeat the same by entering the supplychain folder in the terminal.
Then in the terminal of the backend folder, execute `nodemon` after starting xampp (setup the database first). 
Run `npm start` in the supplychain terminal.
